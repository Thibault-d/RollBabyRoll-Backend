## Description

Chosing the best stroller for your baby shouldn't require a PhD.
Roll Baby Roll is the best Stroller comparator, so you can quickly see and compare what matters for you.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a RESTful API to get experience in making Front and Back end communicate

## User Stories

**View All** - As a user I want to land on the page containing the listing of all Strollers existing in the DB

**Add stroller** - As an Admin user, I want to access a form allowing to add a Stroller in the DB

**Remove stroller** - As an Admin user, I want to be able to remove a Stroller from the DB if the product isn't sold anymore

**Update stroller** - As an admin user, I want to be able to udpate any parameter of any existing Stroller

**404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault

**500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault
